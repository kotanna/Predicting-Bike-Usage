# Predicting Bike Usage in (Metro) Washington, D.C.

In this study, we investigate the use of several different learning algorithms

* k-nearest neighbors;
* logistic regression; 
* multiple linear regression; and
* naïve Bayes 

to predict bike usage in the (metro) Washington, D.C. and determine what, if any, are optimal conditions for maximum and/or minimum bike usage in the metro area. 

The dataset consists of roughly 21,700 response variables. An analysis of the data is performed, and a vector of features is collected and analyzed in Python.
